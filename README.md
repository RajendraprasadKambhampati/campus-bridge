## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/campus-bridge.git
   cd campus-bridge
   

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   bash
   # Install client dependencies
   cd client
   npm install

   # Install server dependencies
   cd ../server
   npm install
   

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a .env file in the server directory with the following variables:
     
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
     PORT=5000
     

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   bash
   cd server
   npm start
   

2. Start the frontend development server:
   bash
   cd ../client
   npm start
   

3. The application should now be running:
   - Backend: http://localhost:5000
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000

## API Documentation

The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for all platform functionality. Detailed API documentation is available via Swagger UI at http://localhost:5000/api-docs when the server is running.
